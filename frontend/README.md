1. ActiveAppointmentsAndHistory.jsx
I built out the component that displays all the active and past appointments. This involved fetching all the meeting data from our backend, sorting them into active and historical categories based on their dates, and then presenting them in clean, easy-to-read tables. 

2. BookWithURL.jsx
I developed the feature that allows users to create bookings by entering a meeting URL. This included handling the form submissions, extracting the meeting ID from the URL, fetching the relevant meeting details, and then creating a new booking in our system. 

3. Landing.jsx
I designed and implemented the landing page for our app. This involved setting up the layout, adding navigation buttons, and ensuring the page is both visually appealing and user-friendly. 

4. Backend Controllers (meeting.js)
On the backend, I worked on the getAllMeetings controller, which retrieves all meeting records from our database. 

5. Frontend Authentication (Login.jsx and Register.jsx)
I created the login and registration forms using HTML and CSS. This included designing the forms to be user-friendly and visually consistent with the rest of the application.
